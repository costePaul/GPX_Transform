Removes some layers on GPX file so that multi-stages gpx (from https://www.viarhona.com or https://www.francevelotourisme.com for example) can be fully visualised on GPX Viewer.

Use : ```python3 gpx_transform <original_gpx_file_path> <new_gpx_name>```

The output file will be named 'same-path/output-same-name.gpx' and the ```<name>``` inside the file will be set to '<new_gpx_name>' so it is named 'new_gpx_name' on GPX Viewer.
